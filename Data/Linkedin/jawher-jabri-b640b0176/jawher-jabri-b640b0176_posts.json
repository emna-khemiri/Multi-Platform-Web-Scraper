After fine-tuning, we improved performance on 15 tasks! 🏆 \n\nDespite no supervision, these #LLMs learned to focus attention on specific genomic features, including key regulatory elements 🔑 such as enhancers, potentially aiding in the prioritisation of functionally important genetic variants 🏁\n\nWe hope that the training and application of these #LLMs in #genomics will provide a stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence alone 🧑‍🔬🚀 \n\n🧑‍💻Want to work on projects like this one? We are #hiring, and want to hear from you! Check out all the open #opportunities and apply at www.instadeep.com/careers \n\n#AIcareers #AIjobs #Genomicscareers #Genomicsjobs ",

How is it important?\n\n👩‍💻 Local founders will be emboldened by seeing real success stories and more entrepreneurs will rise\n💰 Founding team and investors have acquired wealth which can now be reinvested in the local scene to support other founders and know-how to navigate growth challenges\n💸 External investors are seeing more exits in the region which will drive further investments in 2023\n\n2023 is starting with a bang for North Africa and I can foresee it to be a great year for the region, and the wider African start-up landscape. We need more stories like this and game changers such as Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim, and I'm excited at the prospect of seeing more like them in the near future!\n\nRead the article here: https://lnkd.in/euiNTbcB\n\nThe deep-dive I have written about North Africa is available in the comments.\n\n#northafrica #startup #exit #instadeep #tunisia",

                "text": "There are four types of Artificial Intelligence: Reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self awareness.\n Beginning with Reactive Machines : This type of AI performs basic operations.\n\n This level of AI is the simplest. A machine Learning that takes a human face as an input and output a box around the face to identify it as a face is a simple, reactive machine.\n\nAlthough static machine models are reactive machines. These models can be downloaded, traded, passed around into developer's tool kit with ease. Going to Limited Memory that have the ability to store previous Data in order to make better predictions.\n With limited memory, machine learning architecture becomes a little more complex.\n\nConcerning the theory of mind, it can be seen in things like self-driving cars. In other words, in this type, AI begins to interact with the thoughts and emotions of humans.\n Finishing with self awareness, this type of AI exists only in stories, and as stories often do, instills both immense amounts of hope and fear into audiences. Here we're talking about independent intelligence beyond human.\n\n To conclude, AI is a strong software tool for the future that's here to stay. It's eliminating repetitive tasks in the workforce and elevating humans to reach higher selves, embracing constant states of change and creativity.\n\n For more insightful content: https://lnkd.in/eQFAVtrz\n\n #artificialIntelligence #artificialintelligenceai #ai #types #of #ai",
